### Understanding Linear Regression

* Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X).
* It aims to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in multiple dimensions) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values.
* It's widely used for prediction and understanding the influence of variables.
